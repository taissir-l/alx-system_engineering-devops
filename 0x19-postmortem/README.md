# Postmortem: WeatherPy Service Outage

## Issue Summary
**Duration:**  
Start: June 1, 2024, 09:00 AM (UTC)  
End: June 1, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)

**Impact:**  
The WeatherPy service experienced a complete outage, affecting 100% of users. During this time, users were unable to access personalized weather forecasts, receive weather alerts, or interact with any features of the application.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which resulted in an inability to route traffic correctly to the backend servers.

## Timeline
- **09:00 AM (UTC):** Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating a 100% failure rate on incoming requests.
- **09:05 AM (UTC):** Engineering team received the alert and began investigating.
- **09:10 AM (UTC):** Initial assumption was that the issue was due to a spike in traffic overloading the servers.
- **09:20 AM (UTC):** Checked server logs, which showed no indication of excessive load.
- **09:30 AM (UTC):** Escalated to the network engineering team to investigate potential network issues.
- **09:45 AM (UTC):** Network team confirmed no anomalies in network traffic or hardware.
- **10:00 AM (UTC):** Re-evaluated load balancer configuration and identified a recent change in the routing rules.
- **10:15 AM (UTC):** Misleading path: investigated application code for potential bugs, found none.
- **10:30 AM (UTC):** Focus shifted back to load balancer configuration.
- **10:45 AM (UTC):** Discovered a typo in the load balancer's routing rules.
- **11:00 AM (UTC):** Corrected the load balancer configuration and restarted the service.
- **11:15 AM (UTC):** Service functionality verified, users began regaining access.
- **11:30 AM (UTC):** Full service restored, monitoring confirmed normal operation.

## Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:**  
The outage was caused by a typo in the load balancer's routing rules, which was introduced during a configuration update. The incorrect rule prevented the load balancer from directing traffic to the backend servers, resulting in all incoming requests failing.

**Resolution:**  
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. The load balancer configuration was reviewed and the typo in the routing rules was identified.
2. The incorrect rule was corrected to ensure proper routing of traffic to the backend servers.
3. The load balancer was restarted to apply the changes.
4. The system was monitored to confirm that traffic was being correctly routed and that service was restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements:**
1. **Configuration Review Process:** Implement a more rigorous review process for configuration changes, including peer reviews and automated syntax checks.
2. **Automated Testing:** Develop automated tests for configuration files to catch errors before they are deployed.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Improve monitoring to include alerts for misconfigurations in addition to performance metrics.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Load Balancer Configuration Tools:** Update tools used for configuring load balancers to include syntax validation.
2. **Implement Peer Review:** Establish a mandatory peer review process for all configuration changes.
3. **Create Automated Tests:** Develop and integrate automated tests for load balancer configuration files into the CI/CD pipeline.
4. **Expand Monitoring:** Enhance existing monitoring to include specific checks for configuration issues and routing errors.
5. **Conduct Training:** Provide additional training for engineers on the importance of careful configuration management and the new review processes.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages in the future and ensure a more robust and reliable WeatherPy service.
